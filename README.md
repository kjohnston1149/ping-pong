# _Ping-Pong Counter_

#### _Creates a numerical list with rules and condtions based on JavaScript logic, August 19 2016_

#### By _**Kevin Johnston**_

## Description

_This program is a counting application with specific rules and conditions.  When a user inputs a number into the form, the program will output a numerical list from 1 to the specified number.  However, if a number on that list is divisible by 3, the program will replace it with "ping",  if a number is divisible by 5 the program will replace it with "pong", and if a number is divisible by 15 the program will replace it with "ping-pong".  This is accomplished by using loop and array functions in JavaScript with jQuery functions._
